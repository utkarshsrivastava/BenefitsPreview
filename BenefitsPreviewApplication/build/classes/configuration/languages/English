# Imagine, that this comes from the product side..
# imagine that there is a UI based application that allows product to dictate
# what should be displayed in the UI of BenefitsApplication and change it seemlessly
# these values are  vetted by senior product people before being entered into the database . we then get the values at runtime
# this way, we decouple business logic from languages nad give product the freedom to test their changes
#without them relying on developers. they just restart the application and the changes are reflected.
